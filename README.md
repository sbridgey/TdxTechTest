# Tdx Tech Test!

I decided to create a dotnetcore application to upload employee files, store the data and view it.

# Sample File

There is a sample file you can use to add some data to the system 

# Database

I am using an EF Core in memory database so i don't need to install SqlServer to create the application

# Wish List

## Javascript
Add a javascript framework like React or Angular to facilitate a nicer file upload interface and allow for a nice front end file validation system

Use javascript to show error messages from backend validation eg. toastr

## Api

Return the error messages properly (at all), the current state only really works properly for valid files

## Unit Tests

Add some unit tests and switch to a TDD style of development, if i had more time i'd of done this.

## Styling

Update the styling so that the data is displayed in an easy to read grid with a header and remove the unused pages

##  Error Messages

The error messages need updating to include a row number
